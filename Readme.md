## Simple "Like" Button

> This is a "Like" button that tracks the number of times the button has been clicked and displays that number on the button itself, as well as pluralizes "like"/"likes" appropriately.

Objective: To familiarize myself with the basics of Angular.

A deployed version of the app can be viewed here:
